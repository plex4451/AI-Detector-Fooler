## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.


## Installation
This project requires Python 3.9.1 or higher to run.

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the required packages:
    ```bash

   On some systems you may need to put python in front of the command:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

   **python** may also be replaced with **python3** or **py** on some systems.

That's it! You can now run the project.
   
   
## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
